# CS-415-Projects
Class projects for CS 415 (Game development) at UIUC

At present, contains:
* **Infinite Matrix**: Credit to [this tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/168091/create-simple-game-unreal-engine-4) for the base game. I added a few features, all fairly rudimentary: a health system, a score system, health packs (the red disks that spawn), enemies (the black disks that spawn), the ability to fire a projectile (by clicking), and difficulty scaling (the game speed increases and more enemies spawn). I also added a few aesthetic bits for the creative portion, including dynamically coloring the health bar and a screen shake upon taking damage.
